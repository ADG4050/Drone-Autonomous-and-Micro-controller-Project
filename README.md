# Autonomous and Micro-controller-UAV-Project
This code was developed for purely academic purposes by (Group - 1 CPS) as part of the module of Cyber Physical System (EE5C21) in Trinity College Dublin.

This report is for the four drone challenges that were performed as part of the Cyber-Physical Systems Lab. These include the handheld controller, the autonomous flight, the advanced controller, and the advanced autonomous flight control. A crazyflie drone is used for all these purposes, which easily connects to the software cfclient or any mobile device. The drone is mapped to the software using an R-F dongle that connects using the drone address. The Crazyflie drone supports various kinds
of decks namely the flow deck, the Z-ranger deck, the lighthouse deck, etc... The Lighthouse deck is predominately used here for all the challenges as it supports a co-ordinate based positioning system that enables easy position commands to the drone with high precision compared to other decks.

In the controller part, we explored various control opportunities first through an Arduino Controller with its joystick library and then through a hand tracker using AI libraries Media pipe and open CV. More details about each method are demonstrated below. 

In the autonomous flight control, first, a basic drone forward/backward/left/right movement was performed. In the advanced challenge together with one more drone, a swarm activity of drones was performed with different series. The challenges and details are explored in the report https://github.com/ADG4050/Drone-Autonomous-and-Micro-controller-Project/blob/main/CPS.pdf
